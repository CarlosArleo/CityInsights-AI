Subject: Following Up: AI for Regenerative Urban Design

Dear Commonplace Team,

I tried calling earlier today and was hoping to be directed to the best person to speak with regarding digital innovation at your practice.

My name is Carlos Enrique Arleo, and I am an architect and urban researcher based in Newcastle. I have followed Commonplace's work for some time and am deeply impressed by your commitment to people-centric and regenerative design.

My own PhD research focused on developing a framework for more equitable and regenerative masterplanning. To take this theory into practice, I have developed a functional AI-powered platform that operationalizes the framework. In short, it's a tool designed to help practices like yours analyze project documents and proactively model the equity impacts of urban plans.

I believe this approach strongly aligns with Commonplace's mission, and I've prepared a brief, 5-minute video demonstration to make the concept tangible:

I am confident this could bring significant value to your work. Could you please forward this email to the appropriate person on your team who handles digital practice or strategic innovation? I would be very grateful for the opportunity for a brief conversation.

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Best regards,

Carlos Enrique Arleo
