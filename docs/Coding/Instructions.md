1. For Architectural Cohesion and Refinement:


•	You could say: "Review the current application architecture. Propose and implement changes to improve code quality, maintainability, and alignment with best practices, using the project documents as our guide."

•	What this lets me do: This prompt allows me to shift my focus from adding new features to improving the quality of existing ones. I can perform refactoring (like creating custom hooks), improve file organization, ensure consistency, and address any "technical debt" that may have accumulated. This leads to a more balanced and professional architecture.


2. To Define and Reach a "Finished" State (Version 1.0):



•	You could say: "Analyze all the project documents, particularly 'The Chimera Protocol 3.0' and 'Firebase Project Initialization'. Identify the remaining critical features needed to consider the app 'Version 1.0 complete'. Propose and implement a plan to build out these final features."
•	What this lets me do: This is the key to defining a finish line. It instructs me to act like a project lead:
o	I will conduct a "gap analysis" between the vision in your documents and the current state of the code.
o	I will identify the most important missing pieces (like the full AQAL-IDG profile, the "Psychophysiological Signature" report, or the final AI persona evolutions).
o	I will propose a logical sequence to build these final features, ensuring they are integrated coherently.


3. For Polishing the User Experience:

•	You could say: "Focus on improving the overall user experience and visual polish of the application. Review all user-facing components and flows, and implement changes to make them more intuitive, aesthetically pleasing, and engaging, based on the UX principles in the research documents."


•	What this lets me do: This prompt allows me to focus purely on the frontend and user journey. I can add subtle animations, improve layout and spacing, ensure consistent styling, and refine the conversational flow of the AI to make the app feel truly premium and complete.
