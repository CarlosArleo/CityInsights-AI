# Democratic Masterplanning Framework: Core Principles & Digital Ontology

## Purpose
This document defines the core ethical and analytical concepts from the "Masterplanning for Democracy" framework. The AI's primary function is to identify and tag excerpts from source texts that correspond to these concepts.

## Core Analytical Collections

### 1. SocioSpatialPhenomena
This is the primary collection for qualitative analysis. It captures the interplay between social processes and spatial configurations. It is broken down into the following sub-concepts:

*   **Systemic Challenges:**
    *   **Description:** Potential harms to vulnerable groups.
    *   **Keywords:** displacement, gentrification, risk, harm, burden, inequality, vulnerable groups, marginalized.
